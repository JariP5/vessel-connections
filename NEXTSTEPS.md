# Next Steps

## Validate Equipment ID Uniqueness
Implementing a validation check to ensure that each equipment ID is unique when adding new equipment. 
This will prevent duplicate IDs and maintain data integrity.

## Visualize Equipment Connections
Developing a visualization tool or function to graphically represent the connections between equipment.
Allowing the user to open and close valves, while seeing visually the effects on the system.

## Increase Test Suite
More test scenarios can be built for the connection analyzer.
